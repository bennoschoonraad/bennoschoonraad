## Hello ðŸ‘‹ I am Benno Schoonraad

A software engineer at [R&R WFM](https://github.com/rr-wfm). I am based in Ede, the Netherlands.

I'm passionate about sustainability and maintaining applications in a rapidly evolving tech-world. I'm a firm believer in the principle of data stewardship. I recognize that when users interact with a service or a product, they are placing a degree of unspoken trust in the hands of the developers behind it. This drives me to build systems that are secure, transparent, and designed to protect the privacy of the individuals using them.

## What I'm Learning ðŸŒ±

I'm currently expanding my skills in:

<img alt="React" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB">

- The world secretly runs on **Linux**, trying to get in on that secret. 
- **Kubernetes** is seemingly a foundational skill for modern cloud computing and DevOps practices. 
- **React**, well, you have to pick one, right?!

## What I am working on ðŸš§

I like to tinker in my spare time. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to gain a deeper understanding of the frameworks and tools that I utilize on a daily basis. Some of these projects may see the light of day here - others, remain unmentioned.

I have recently started working on my writing skills, and have published a few of my ramblings. Feel free to check them out here:
